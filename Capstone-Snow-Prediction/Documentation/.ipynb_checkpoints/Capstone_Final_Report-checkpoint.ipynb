    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "The unpredictable nature of snow depth poses challenges for resource planning in water management and recreational industries. Current prediction methods often lack accuracy in varying climates. A model that improves snow depth forecasts could help optimize water usage and support sustainable tourism. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**  \n",
    "Accurate snow depth predictions help in disaster preparedness, resource management, and improving operational efficiency in snow-sensitive industries. Snow plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem and adding vital moisture to the arid environment of Northern Utah. Additionally, snowmelt is essential for regional watersheds dependent on runoffs during summer months. In particular, the Wasatch Range is a critical water source for major metropolitan areas like Salt Lake City. Snow is also a key economic resource, with the ski industry a main driver for tourism. For instance, Utah’s 2023-24 ski season attracted 6.7 million visitors. Given the rising interest in winter recreation, changes in the snow depth may significantly impact local communities, industries, and governments. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The developed model achieves high accuracy in snow depth predictions, proving its value for environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource optimization. By leveraging Bayesian optimization and feature selection, the model balances complexiity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results suggest the importance of integrating environmental, temporal, and statistical data to enhance prediction accuracy. From mitigating risk of extreme snowfall events to supporting sustainable water resource management, this model establishes a strong foundation for future research and advancements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration of deep learning algorithms, incorporation of additional features, and the assessment of climate change impacts are a few examples of studies that could expand on this current analysis. These research directions will further refine the capability of predictive snow depth models and contribute to the overall wealth and knowledge in environmental modeling.  \n",
